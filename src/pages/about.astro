          <p>
            I'm Dani, a software engineer and University of Bucharest graduate with nearly 5 years of experience in mobile application development. I'm passionate about technology and how it can drive meaningful improvements in workflows and user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm results-oriented and approach each project with attention to detail. I prefer to understand requirements thoroughly before implementation and collaborate effectively with teams to deliver quality solutions within realistic timeframes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in continuous learning and adapting to new technologies to stay relevant in the industry and contribute to increasingly complex and interesting projects.
          </p>

            On the home page, you can see the three aspects that define me: Christian, Developer, and Reader. My Christian faith provides me with a solid perspective on professional values and responsibilities, guiding me in all aspects of my work.

        <p>
          Software development is not just my profession, but also my passion. I enjoy solving complex problems and building useful applications that make a difference for users. At the core of my professional activity are Christian values and principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third aspect, "Reader," reflects my passion for learning. Although I initially didn't enjoy reading, university changed my perspective and now I consider reading an excellent method for personal and professional development. I read various books, with an emphasis on theology and personal development.
        </p>
        <H2 text="Why work together?" />
        <p>
          I aim to approach each project with the necessary professionalism. Being early in my career, I have the availability and energy to fully engage in challenging projects. I've established a company that allows me to efficiently manage collaborations with multiple clients, benefiting from the support of a trusted accountant for administrative aspects. This way, I can focus on what I do best: developing quality software solutions.
        </p>
        <H2 text="Let's connect" />
        <p>
          If you have an interesting project or technical challenge that you think I could help you solve, don't hesitate to contact me. I respond promptly to all messages.
        </p>
