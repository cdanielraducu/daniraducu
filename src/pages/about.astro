          <p>
            I'm Dani, a CTI Engineer and University of Bucharest graduate with nearly 5 years of experience as a mobile developer. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to drive meaningful improvements and add value to the work I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm committed to purposeful work, avoiding actions performed solely for their own sake. I'm proactive in asking questions to effectively plan and execute tasks with precision, and I embrace challenges with determination as a persistent problem-solver, always reaping knowledge rewards from every experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm dedicated to continuous learning and skill enhancement to deliver innovative solutions and maximize impact through hard work.

            On the home page, you've probably noticed the three chips that
            describe me: Christian, Developer, and Reader. My faith as a
            Christian influences everything I do, including my work, as I strive
            to do everything by God's grace for Him!

          Being a developer is not just my vocation but also my passion. I enjoy
          solving interesting problems and creating useful things. But at the
          core of it all is my identity as a Christian.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third chip, "Reader," represents one of my most visible hobbies.
          Surprisingly, I didn't like reading until I entered university, but
          I've come to appreciate it as a helpful habit. I make an effort to
          read as much as possible on various topics, with a particular focus on
          Theology books.
        </p>
        <H2 text="Why choosing to work with me?" />
        <p>
          I want to work responsibly. I am young and have time to spare - that's
          a thing that I've discovered lately is that with only one client. But
          I could also take more to work on. That is why I've created a company.
          It allows me to easily work for more than one client if needed. With
          it I also am being able to track every paper work required by a
          trusted accountant. That way, I can focus more on the work itself and
          not so much of the other administration things.
        </p>

          If you want me to solve a problem for you, feel free to reach out! I'll respond shortly.
